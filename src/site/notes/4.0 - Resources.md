## Resources

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet. Duis sagittis ipsum. Praesent mauris. Fusce nec tellus sed augue semper porta. Mauris massa. Vestibulum lacinia arcu eget nulla. 

### Download Links

We can do all sorts with this, simple links (the below don't link anywhere):

- [Project Documents](https://findingrefuge.vercel.app/resources)
- [Maps](https://findingrefuge.vercel.app/resources)
- [Brand Guidance](https://findingrefuge.vercel.app/resources)
- [Video Downloads](https://findingrefuge.vercel.app/resources)

We could also just link to a drop box which could serve as a resource pack. The benefit of this is it's easy to keep the content up to date without having to change the website.

### We can also present things visually too

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start;">
    <div style="width: 300px; text-align: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: space-between;">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RtgRMzz.png" alt="Image" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;">
        <div>
            <h3 style="margin: 10px 0 0 0;">Project Plan</h3>
            <p>Our project has been designed to incorporate fine-tuning our plan as we proceed through each phase; Connectivity Modelling; Wildlife Corridor Design; and Wildlife Connectivity Action Plan</p>
        </div>
        <button onclick="window.location.href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltDT79Ycq5SdYxyKCFcp7DZF7MeB-DaU/view';">Learn More</button>
    </div>
