## A Road Map for The Allotment

This is a road map for the features I'd like to build into The Allotment. If you have any ideas, please get in touch.

## Road Map

The allotment is still very new, I'm still laying the ground work. Here is a little road map of what I'd like to implement. The project will run in phases as there are some things I cannot do and will need to seek support from actual web developers, if the time comes:

Stuff I can do:

All this should fall nicely within the capabilities of a digital garden:

- [x] Set up a website: a place for the allotment to live (will use a digital garden format) 
- [ ] Dedicated Domain: I need to sort out a domain for this site.
- [x] Submission form: Build in a form for users to submit their gardens.
- [x] Directory: a directory of digital gardens that visitors can browse
- [x] Filtering/Searching: a tagging system to make categorising gardens easy
- [ ] New gardens: a place to showcase new gardeners

Stuff I can't do:

This is the stuff which would probably need a server side function or something which is not what I'm really looking for with this site:

- [ ] Profiles: A profile system so users can login and customise their allotment path
- [ ] Favouriting: A method of allowing users to favourite digital gardens
