## The Wildlife Connectivity Project

We are using the power of collaboration to help create a better approach to land use planning and conserve biodiversity  in our ecologically rich area, now under increasing pressure from human influence and climate change. Our work is aligned with [Canada’s 2030 Nature Strategy](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/biodiversity/canada-2030-nature-strategy.html) which is intended to coordinate land management activities across all levels of government and enhance collaboration with NGO and Indigenous-led conservation initiatives.
